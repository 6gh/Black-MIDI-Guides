## Installation

!!! info "Different PFA Versions"

    As discussed in the home page, there are 3 versions of PFAo which you can choose. Click on a link to be directed to visit their download pages:

    -   [The 32-bit version](https://github.com/brian-pantano/PianoFromAbove/releases/download/1.1.0/PFA-1.1.0-x86.exe)
    -   [The 64-bit version](https://github.com/brian-pantano/PianoFromAbove/releases/download/1.1.0/PFA-1.1.0-x86_64.exe)
    -   [Khang's viz mod](https://github.com/khang06/PianoFromAbove/releases)

    You are free to choose any version you'd wish to use, but I will be using the official versions.

First, download the version you can use. 32-bit is for x86 OSes, 64-bit is for x64 OSes.

??? note "How do i know if im on x86 or x64?"

    First, type in the search bar "System Information" and open it. In the "System Type" line you will see if you're on x64 or x86.
