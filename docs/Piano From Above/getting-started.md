# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with Piano From Above.

## Installation

!!! info "Different PFA Versions"

    As discussed in the home page, there are 3 versions of PFA which you can choose. Click on a link to be directed to visit their download pages:

    -   [The 32-bit version](https://github.com/brian-pantano/PianoFromAbove/releases/download/1.1.0/PFA-1.1.0-x86.exe)
    -   [The 64-bit version](https://github.com/brian-pantano/PianoFromAbove/releases/download/1.1.0/PFA-1.1.0-x86_64.exe)
    -   [Khang's viz mod](https://github.com/khang06/PianoFromAbove/release/latest)

    You are free to choose any version you'd wish to use, but I will be using the official versions.

First, download the version you can use. 32-bit is for x86 OSes, 64-bit is for x64 OSes.


??? note "How do I know if I'm on 32-bit or 64-bit system?"

    First, type in the search bar "System Information" and open it. In the "System Type" line you will see if you're on x64 or x86.

## Adding MIDI Files
When you first open PFA, you will just see a startup MIDI with nothing else. We need to add some MIDI files to change that.

First press Control + F to open up a file selecter. Go to location of your midi file, select it and press open. It might take some RAM, CPU AND GPU usage to load it.

After that in the library you will see the midi file, double click it and now you're playing a MIDI!

## Viewing 128 keys
PFA is normally at 88 keys. To change that press Control + P to open preferences. Here change "Show all 88 keys" to "Show song keys". Press OK and now you have 128 keys if the midi file you're playing has that key range.

> TODO: Add instruction on how to edit the config.yml to always show 128 keys
