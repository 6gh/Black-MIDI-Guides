## What is Black MIDI?

Black MIDI is a music genre consisting of compositions that use the MIDI format to create a song or a remix containing a large number of notes. People who produce Black MIDIs are known as blackers. It is usually done by filling up the sheet with many thousands or millions of abnormally short notesâ€”from 32nd notes and smaller. Most blackened songs are remixes from existing songs, but compositions for the genre have been made.

The word "black" in "Black MIDI" refers to the appearance of the composition on Western Musical Notation, appearing almost or completely blackened.

!!! warning "Viewer Discretion"

    Black MIDI songs have flashing visuals that can cause epileptic seizures in photosensitive individuals, therefore it is advised to approach Black MIDI with caution if you are affected by photosensitivity.

Currently, OvertureMIDI (maintainers of blackmidi.wiki) is working on a Black MIDI Wiki for a bunch of information on Black MIDI. It is still in development as of right now and not public. We are looking for skilled, experienced, and knowledgable blackers to propel and fact check our information.

We will announce when the Encyclopedia Black MIDIca is in service. For now, you are free to visit the [fandom page for Black MIDI](https://blackmidi.fandom.com/wiki/Home) (not maintained by OvertureMIDI)
