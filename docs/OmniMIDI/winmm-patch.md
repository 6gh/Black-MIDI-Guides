# WinMM Patch

This guide will help you patch PFA.

## Patching PFA

In the configurator window, go to "extensions" and select "Windows Multimedia Wrapper"
Select "Patch an application" below the standard performance improvement patch.
Then, go to where your PFA exe is, select it and it should be patched.

??? note "Why can't I patch it?"

    If it says you dont have the permissions to do this, press OK and run the configurator as an administrator. (The configurator should automatically run it as an admin after clicking OK)
