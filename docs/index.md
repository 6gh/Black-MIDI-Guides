Welcome to Black MIDI Guides. Here you will find guides for a bunch of things people often ask help with in Black MIDI Communities

## Purpose

A lot of times in Black MIDI communities, people often ask how to x, how to y, whats the best way to do z, etc. So I've taken the initiative to try to make guides to help newcomers get started on the right foot on their Black MIDI journey. My goal is to provide easy to follow guides for a variety of things, and perhaps even video tutorials to along with them!

### Disclaimer

As I don't have _a lot_ of experience in blacking, some guides might not be the best way to do things and as such I will try to get information from other more experienced blackers for certain guides. You can also [contribute](#contributing) yourself to the guides as all of the documentation is open-source on Github under an MIT License.
