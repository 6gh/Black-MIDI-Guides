# Configuring Audio

When you first boot up Domino, you may notice that you do not have any audio playing. That is because by default Domino has no MIDI outs setup. This is how you setup Domino to play audio.

??? warning "Synth Required"

    For this to work, you will need a synth setup and running on your system. Windows provides a default synthesizer for you, but it is terrible in performance.
    I recommend you to use [OmniMIDI](/OmniMIDI) for your synthesizer as this synth was made for Black MIDIs and provides the best performance.
