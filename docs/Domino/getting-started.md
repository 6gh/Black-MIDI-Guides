# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started on downloading and setting up Domino for the best working environment

## Installation

!!! info "Different Domino Versions"

    As discussed in the home page, there are 3 versions of Domino which you can choose. Click on a link to be directed to visit their download pages:

    -   [The normal 32-bit version](https://takabosoft.com/domino)
    -   [The community-translated version](https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/releases/latest)
    -   [The 64-bit dev version]()

    You are free to choose any version you'd wish to use, but I will be using the english translated version.

First, download the version of Domino you wish to use.

??? note "For the english translated version, you will want the **zip version**."

Unzip the file you downloaded anywhere you'd like and you should see the following files:

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Domino. Feel free to create a shortcut or something to your Desktop or pin to your taskbar.
