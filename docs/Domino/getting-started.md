# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started on downloading and setting up Domino for the best working environment

## Installation

!!! info "Different Domino Versions"

    As discussed in the home page, there are 3 versions of Domino which you can choose. Click on a link to be directed to visit their download pages:

    -   [The normal 32-bit version](https://takabosoft.com/domino)
    -   [The community-translated version](https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/releases/latest)
    -   [The 64-bit dev version](download/Domino145_dev002_x64.zip)

    You are free to choose any version you'd wish to use, but I will be using the english translated version.

First, download the version of Domino you wish to use.

??? note "For the english translated version, you will want the **zip version**."

Unzip the file you downloaded anywhere you'd like and you should see the following files:

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Domino. Feel free to create a shortcut or something to your Desktop or pin to your taskbar.

## Enabling Overlapping Notes

By default, Domino will remove notes on the same tick and in the same track. This is sometimes not ideal when making Black MIDIs, but is a setting you can fortunately change! Here is how to do it

On the toolbar, click the wrench icon to open up your preferences. You can also just click <kbd>F12</kbd>

Click on the 2nd option, and change "Notes on the same tick and key" to "Keep"

??? note "Japanese UI"

    ![Change to keep EN](images/jp-ui/OverlappingNotesSetting.png)

You can now click OK to save your changes. After which you will be able to place multiple notes on the same tick and the same track, thus overlapping notes!
