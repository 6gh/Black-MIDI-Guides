# Domino

Here are some Domino guides to help you get started and better use Domino to it's fullest potential.

??? info "What is Domino?"

    Domino is a japanese MIDI editor developed by TAKABO SOFT.
    It is very well known in the Black MIDI community for its superior speed and performance over the other biggest contender of FL Studio.
    Domino's biggest weakness is being a 32-bit program, but recently there has been a discovery of a 64-bit version as well.

## Different Domino Versions

Domino has 3 versions of which you can choose:

-   The normal 32-bit version
-   The community-translated version
-   The 64-bit dev version

The normal 32-bit version and the 64-bit dev version are japanese only. This will require you to [install the Japanese Language Pack for your system](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/language-packs-for-windows-a5094319-a92d-18de-5b53-1cfc697cfca8). The community-translated version is **only for a 32-bit exe as of right now**.

These guides will focus on using the community-translated english version, and so screenshots shown will be of the english version. There will also be a screenshot of the japanese versions available through a dropdown in each guide.
